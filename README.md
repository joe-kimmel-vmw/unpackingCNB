work in progress. 

a series of scripts and commits that show step-by-step how to run the CNB lifecycle executables directly for each phase (without the pack tool).


##Setup

Create the following environment variables pointing to locations in your local filesystem.

- `CNB_SAMPLES_PATH` : points to a local checkout of the buildpacks/samples git repo. For me:  
```export CNB_SAMPLES_PATH="`pwd`/../buildpacks-samples"```
